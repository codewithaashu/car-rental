              invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of
              such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
              provisions of the Terms of Use, which shall remain in full force
              and effect. No waiver of any provision of these Terms of Use shall
              be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other
              term, and RodBezâ€™s failure to assert any right or provision under
